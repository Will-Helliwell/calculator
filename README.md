# Calculator

## About and Approach
- A simple calculator app, used to familiarise myself with node.js.
- Deliberately following a procedural  approach (plan is to compare with an OOP approach later).
- Originally planned a non-tested approach (for the same reason as above), but it quickly became apparent that I would never build something like this without automated testing. There are so many small pieces of functionality and edge cases that it seems the only sensible way to be sure the calculator is working as intended.

## Planning

### Desired features
#### Basic
- Clickable numbers and operators
- Numbers and symbols appear on the screen in order clicked

#### Single operators
- Pressing equals:
  - Adds two numbers and returns the answer
  - Subtracts " "
  - Divides " "
  - Multiplies " "

#### Multiple operators
- Pressing equals:
  - Adds/subrtracts/multiplies/divides >2 numbers and returns the answer


- Clicking AC returns screen to blank and removes any stored data
